A quick To-Do list (so people don't clash on what they work on)
===============================================================

Empty brackets next to filenames in source means that someone isn't working on
it. Plz use IRC or something to contact me (MistaRhee@freenode) 
(webchat.freenode.net to access) if you want more details etc.

Novel Details: (MistaRhee)
    - Get something on the screen
    - Make it look pretty

Novel List ():
    - Finish implementing the scroll down method for it. The selection and all
      the other back-end stuff are done, just rendering left to do

    - Debug it, make sure it works properly
        * What it's supposed to do is display all the novels in a list and
        * scroll down as you are looking down it

Reader ():
    - Implement EVERYTHING
    - Nothing has been done on this 

settings - In general, there is no file for this yet ():
    - Change font size/zoom
    - Change the foreground/background colour

MultiThreaded downloads():
    - Optimize/change the program so that everything runs on one thread, and
      when a user initiates a download, it starts a new thread.

Stored updates():
    - Have a file which writes all updates into and then have a tab which a
      user can pull out what novels/chapters etc. were updated

External Site():
    - This may be a little risky, because we might run into other copyright
      issues (BT people said they were fine with it, but others might be kinda
      mad that we dl the stuff) DO AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
    - Download externally hosted novels as html files and then display on
      userland's favourite browser.
