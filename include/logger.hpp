/* Logger.hpp -> A simple logging system
 * =====================================
 * Justin Huang (MistaRhee)
 *
 * Tl;dr Logger is a simle logging system. Just start up the class and let it do it's thing. Logger
 * can be run on a separate thread (and is recommended to be) however, you can set the flag for it
 * to be a static logger.
 *
 * Licensing (Really? You power hungry people -_-)
