Baka-Tsuki Reader for PC (Something which I'm doing in my spare time)
=====================================================================

tl;dr this is just an app which will read the BT site and download novels so
people can access offline. Just something to make life easier I guess? Was
suggested to me by NoOne2246 (find him on git as well). Also, this will only be
for English TLs only, sorry, but I just can't find the effort to do any more
then what NoOne2246 wanted of me.

License and stuff

(Note: I'm surprised that people actually are reading this. Have fun wasting
these seconds of time which you are reading this note and realising that this
note is actually pointless and is not worth NOTICING)

Not that I really mind if you take stuff from here... just be nice and you
know, acknowledge me a bit. Maybe even donate money to charity if you really
feel guilty about taking the intellectual property from a kid off the internet.

Compiling
---------

I'm not even there yet, but

$make

is usually how this works (I think). When it actually works, it'll only be
tested under GNU/Linux. Should work for Windows with a few tweaks I guess.

Dependencies
------------

- SDL2
- libCurl

Maybe more stuff later, but I'll be adding to it. No funny business here. Sorry
to disappoint.

Not So Dependencies
-------------------

This program uses pugixml, which is a pretty cool library, especially since it
doesn't require any libraries (FREEDOM~) and so you should show it some love,
you know, just to keep the library alive.
